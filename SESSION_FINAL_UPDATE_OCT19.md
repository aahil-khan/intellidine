2. Kitchen Display System (KDS) push notifications
3. Customer order status updates
4. Kafka → Socket.io event bridge
5. All real-time features tested

**Expected Outcome**: Real-time notifications for all users

### Step 2.1: API Gateway Refinement (1-2 hours)
1. Service discovery validation
2. Request enrichment with user context
3. Response standardization
4. Multi-tenant isolation verification
5. Rate limiting and circuit breakers

**Expected Outcome**: Production-ready API gateway
