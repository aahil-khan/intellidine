## üìñ File Descriptions

### SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md (20-30 min read)
**What you'll learn**:
- ‚úÖ All 10 services and what they do
- ‚úÖ How services talk to each other
- ‚úÖ Data flow from customer order to kitchen display
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenancy implementation
- ‚úÖ Event-driven architecture with Kafka
- ‚úÖ Authentication flows (OTP vs staff login)
- ‚úÖ Database schema at high level

### Service Documentation (each 10-20 min)
Each service file includes:
- **What it does** - Purpose and responsibilities
- **Key endpoints** - REST API with examples
- **Data models** - Prisma schema relevant to service
- **Kafka events** - What it publishes/consumes
- **Dependencies** - Other services it calls
- **Error handling** - Common issues and solutions
- **Use cases** - Real-world scenarios
- **Testing** - How to test the service

### Workflow Documentation (15-30 min each)
Each workflow file traces:
- **Step-by-step** - Exact sequence of operations
- **Service interactions** - Which services are involved
- **Data transformations** - How data changes through flow
- **Event publishing** - What Kafka events are emitted
- **Error scenarios** - What can go wrong and recovery
- **Examples** - Real customer scenarios with data

## üéØ Key Concepts to Understand

### Multi-Tenancy
Intellidine is **SaaS** - many restaurants use the same system, completely isolated:
- Each restaurant has a `tenant_id` (UUID)
- All data filtered by `tenant_id` at database level
- Staff can only access their restaurant's data
- Customers only see their restaurant's menu

### Stateless Services
All services are **stateless** for scalability:
- No session data stored in services
- Everything stored in PostgreSQL + Redis
- Can run multiple instances behind load balancer
- Any instance can handle any request

### Event-Driven
Services communicate asynchronously via **Kafka**:
- `order.created` ‚Üí triggers Notification, Analytics, Kitchen
- `payment.completed` ‚Üí updates order status
- `inventory.low_stock` ‚Üí alerts management

### ML Integration
XGBoost model predicts optimal discounts:
- Real-time predictions based on current context
- Considers time of day, inventory, demand patterns
- Applied automatically to every order
- No extra API call visible to customer

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Documentation

### Finding Something Specific

**"I need to add a new menu item field"**
‚Üí Check `MENU_SERVICE.md` for endpoints, then `DATABASE.md` for schema

**"Why is my discount not being applied?"**
‚Üí Read `DISCOUNT_APPLICATION.md` workflow, check `DISCOUNT_ENGINE.md` service

**"What happens when customer clicks 'Place Order'?"**
‚Üí Read `ORDERING_WORKFLOW.md` step-by-step with exact service calls

**"How do I test the payment flow?"**
‚Üí Check `PAYMENT_SERVICE.md` for endpoints and `PAYMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for full flow

### Keep Files Open

Bookmark these 3 while developing:
1. `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` - Reference architecture
2. `API_ENDPOINTS.md` - All endpoint signatures
3. Your service-specific file (e.g., `ORDER_SERVICE.md`)

---

## üìû Questions?

Each service file has:
- **Common Issues** section with troubleshooting
- **Examples** with actual request/response JSON
- **Related Files** - links to other relevant documentation

If something isn't clear:
1. Check the related service's README
2. Look in GLOSSARY.md for term definitions
3. Search workflow files for your use case

---

## üìù Maintaining This Documentation

When updating code:
1. Update the service's .md file
2. Update KAFKA_EVENTS.md if events change
3. Update DATABASE.md if schema changes
4. Add new workflow files for major features
5. Update this README with new file descriptions
