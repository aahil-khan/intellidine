## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Middleware Stack (API Gateway)
```
RequestContextMiddleware    → Generates correlation IDs
        ↓
AuthMiddleware              → JWT validation & user extraction
        ↓
TenantVerificationMiddleware → Ensures tenant isolation
        ↓
ServiceRouter               → Routes to 6 microservices
        ↓
ErrorHandlerMiddleware      → Standardizes responses
```

### Event-Driven System
```
Order Service (creates order)
        ↓
Publishes: order.created
        ↓
├─ Payment Service (payment request)
├─ Inventory Service (reserve stock)
├─ Notification Service (user update)
└─ Analytics Service (record order)
```

### Discount Evaluation Flow
```
Order Service
        ↓
Calls: DiscountEngine.evaluateDiscounts()
        ├─ Time-based rules (lunch, dinner)
        ├─ Volume-based rules (bulk)
        ├─ Item-specific rules (combos)
        ├─ Customer segment rules (VIP)
        └─ ML-recommended rules (shadow mode)
        ↓
Returns: Best applicable discount
        ↓
Applies to order final amount
```
