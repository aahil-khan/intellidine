# ðŸ”§ @shared/auth Path Resolution Fix

**Status**: âœ… FIXED  
**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Commit**: 0443a22

## The Problem

During Docker build, services that import `@shared/auth` were failing with:

```
error TS2307: Cannot find module '@shared/auth' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

**Root Cause**: TypeScript path mapping used relative paths (`../shared/auth`) which don't resolve correctly in Docker build context where `shared` is copied to `/app/shared`.

**Affected Services**:
- Order Service
- Inventory Service
- Menu Service
- Payment Service

---

## The Solution

Updated all 4 services' `tsconfig.json` files to use context-relative paths:

### Before
```json
"paths": {
  "@shared/auth": ["../shared/auth"]
},
"include": ["src/**/*", "../shared/auth/**/*"]
```

### After
```json
"paths": {
  "@shared/*": ["./shared/*"]
},
"include": ["src/**/*", "./shared/**/*"]
```

**Why this works**: 
- `baseUrl: "."` sets the resolution root to the build directory
- `./shared/*` correctly maps to `/app/shared` which is where Dockerfile copies it
- Wildcard `*` is more flexible for future shared modules

## What You Need To Do On Your Server

### Step 1: Pull the fix
```bash
cd /opt/intellidine
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Rebuild Order Service (the one that failed)
```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
docker-compose build --no-cache order-service
```

### Step 3: Verify it built successfully
```bash
# Should show "Successfully tagged..."
docker-compose ps order-service

# Should return {"status":"ok"}
curl http://localhost:3002/health
```

### Step 4: Rebuild all affected services to be safe
```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
docker-compose build --no-cache \
  order-service \
  inventory-service \
  menu-service \
  payment-service
```

### Step 5: Start fresh (if builds still fail)
```bash
docker-compose down
docker system prune -a --force
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Files Changed

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `backend/order-service/tsconfig.json` | Path mapping fixed | âœ… |
| `backend/inventory-service/tsconfig.json` | Path mapping fixed | âœ… |
| `backend/menu-service/tsconfig.json` | Path mapping fixed | âœ… |
| `backend/payment-service/tsconfig.json` | Path mapping fixed | âœ… |

## Technical Details

### How Docker Builds Work

```
1. Dockerfile COPY order-service/src ./src
2. Dockerfile COPY shared ./shared
3. Build context now has:
   /app/src/...
   /app/shared/...
   /app/tsconfig.json

4. TypeScript compiler runs with baseUrl="."
5. @shared/* resolves to ./shared/*
6. Now finds /app/shared/auth âœ…
```

### Path Resolution Rules

- `@shared/auth` â†’ Points to `@shared/*` path â†’ Resolves to `./shared/auth` â†’ Found at `/app/shared/auth` âœ…
- Works in all 4 services (order, inventory, menu, payment)
- Backward compatible (no code changes needed)

## Verification Checklist

After pulling and rebuilding, verify:

```bash
# 1. Check Order Service health
curl http://localhost:3002/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"} âœ…

# 2. Check Inventory Service health
curl http://localhost:3004/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"} âœ…

# 3. Check Menu Service health
curl http://localhost:3003/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"} âœ…

# 4. Check Payment Service health
curl http://localhost:3005/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"} âœ…

# 5. Check Docker services are up
docker-compose ps | grep -E "order-service|inventory-service|menu-service|payment-service"
# Expected: All showing "Up X minutes (healthy)" âœ…
```

---

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Run this diagnostic:

```bash
# Check the actual error
docker-compose logs order-service 2>&1 | tail -50 > order_error.txt

# Check if shared directory exists in container
docker-compose exec order-service ls -la /app/shared/auth

# Check tsconfig is correct
docker-compose exec order-service cat /app/tsconfig.json | grep -A2 '"paths"'

# Get all service statuses
docker-compose ps > services.txt

# Send these files to debug
```

## Summary

âœ… **Fix Type**: Configuration  
âœ… **Files Modified**: 4 tsconfig.json files  
âœ… **No Code Changes Required**: Just rebuild containers  
âœ… **Impact**: Order Service, Inventory, Menu, Payment  
âœ… **Status**: Ready to deploy

**Next Steps**: 
1. `git pull` on your server
2. `docker-compose build --no-cache order-service`
3. Verify with `curl http://localhost:3002/health`
4. Report back if any issues!
