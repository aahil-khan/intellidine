Answer These Questions

1) What production domain(s) should we use for API and frontend?
2) Do you already have MSG91 and Razorpay credentials? If yes, share test keys first.
3) Do you want JWT in httpOnly cookies (per PRD) or Authorization headers for local dev?
4) What regions/timezone should be default for analytics aggregations?
5) What initial tenant(s) and sample data should we seed for demo?
