## 🚀 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO ON YOUR SERVER (9 Steps)

You have 2 options:

### **OPTION A: QUICK START (Recommended)**

Follow **DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md** - it has everything in one file, numbered 1-9

```bash
# Just open this file on your server:
cat DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md
```

### **OPTION B: DETAILED GUIDE**

Follow **PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - if you need more details or run into issues

---

## ⚡ SUPER QUICK SUMMARY (Copy-Paste Version)

```bash
# 1. Clone repo
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/aahil-khan/intellidine.git
cd intellidine

# 2. Setup environment
cp ENV.example .env.production
# Edit with: nano .env.production
# Change: JWT_SECRET (run: openssl rand -base64 32)

# 3. Start services
docker-compose up -d --build

# 4. Initialize DB
docker-compose exec api-gateway npx prisma migrate deploy

# 5. Test locally
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# 6. Install Cloudflare tunnel
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64
chmod +x cloudflared-linux-amd64
sudo mv cloudflared-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create intellidine

# 7. Configure tunnel
nano ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
# Paste the YAML from DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md step 6

# 8. Run tunnel as service
sudo cloudflared service install
sudo systemctl start cloudflared
sudo systemctl enable cloudflared

# 9. Add DNS CNAME in Cloudflare Dashboard
# api → intellidine.cfargotunnel.com (Proxied)
# Test: curl https://api.yourdomain.com/health
```
